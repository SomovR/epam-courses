Sometimes I feel cold, even paralyzed
My interior world needs to sanitize
I've got to step through or I'll dissipate
I'll record my step through for my basement tapes

Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
